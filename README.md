### What I Learned

In this project, I reinforced my understanding of:

- **CSS Flexbox:** Used for aligning and spacing elements within the card.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Utilized for maintaining consistent styling across the project.
- **Mobile-first design:** Built with a mobile-first approach and added media queries for larger screens.
- **Focus-visible:** Used to enhance accessibility by providing custom focus styles only when navigating via keyboard.
